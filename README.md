# Analytical Workflow

1. Import and explore the dataset using Python
2. Clean and prepare the data for analysis
3. Generate visualizations to identify trends and patterns
4. Store the processed data in a SQLite database
5. Perform SQL queries to extract insights
6. Document findings in a clear and structured way



# Personal Approach and Design Choice

The use of pink in this project is intentional.
In technology and data-related fields, visual identity often follows very predictable patterns. Choosing pink represents a personal and professional statement: bringing authenticity, creativity, and individuality into a technical space without compromising clarity or rigor.

This project reflects the balance between analytical thinking and personal expression, showing that data work can be precise, thoughtful, and still human.



# Target Audience

This project is intended for:

* People interested in data analytics and data-driven decision making
* Students and professionals transitioning into data careers
* Recruiters and teams looking for analytical thinking and well-structured projects



# Future Improvements

* Add more complex SQL queries and joins
* Expand the dataset and analysis scope
* Integrate additional visualizations
* Connect the project to interactive dashboards
