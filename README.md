## About the Color Choice
The use of pink is intentional.  
This project was built with the same care and passion I have for web development, but with a growing focus on data analysis and data-driven thinking.  
Choosing pink represents my desire to bring personality into my work and move beyond the obvious, neutral color palettes commonly seen in tech.  
It reflects creativity, confidence, and the idea that professionalism and individuality can coexist.

## Target Audience
This project is for anyone interested in data analysis — especially those exploring career transitions, learning paths, or building their first data portfolio.

## Next Steps
